3dSpline
========

Computer Graphic Project
Simply a bezier surface, that can be illuminated by using number of light sources. The 3D coordinate system is all self made using perspective projection equations. Basically, everything done here is pixel plotting. The surface is modeled with Phong model. And the Gourard shading is still not working. There are some mistakes with surface vector computations. Appeared to be my assignment for Computer Graphics. And I haven't been devoted to solve the mistakes since then.
